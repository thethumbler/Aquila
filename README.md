# Aquila OS [![build](https://github.com/thethumbler/aquila/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thethumbler/aquila/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A small UNIX-like operating system: its kernel, C library and system
tools. It's meant to be *boring*: the kernel does what UNIX kernels have
done for decades, the plain way, in code small enough to read in full,
with documents that explain each part of it. It's for people who want
to understand operating systems by reading and changing one, and
especially for those writing their own. It runs on x86 (i386 and
x86-64) and on aarch64 (QEMU's virt machine).

## Start here

You need `gcc`, `ld`, `cpio` and `qemu-system-x86_64`, nothing else:

```
make run-min        # the kernel, booted with one tiny program (a minute)
```

builds the kernel with your gcc and boots it in QEMU with
[start/init.c](start/init.c) as the only program: a tiny shell with no
C library, each of its commands a system call or two. Type `help`;
Ctrl-A X quits QEMU. Then:

1. **Read** [docs/kernel/](docs/kernel/README.md), in order: how the
   kernel boots, takes interrupts, manages memory and processes, and the
   rest, each with pointers into the code. [kernel/](kernel/README.md)
   lists what's where.
2. **Change something.** Add a command to `start/init.c`, or a
   `printk()` to a system call in `kernel/sys/syscall.c`, and
   `make run-min` again.
3. **Debug it.** `make debug` boots the same with debugging information
   and QEMU waiting for gdb: `gdb -x mk/gdbinit` and the kernel file it
   names stops in `kmain()`. A panic prints a stack trace;
   [mk/backtrace.sh](mk/backtrace.sh) names its addresses
   (`mk/backtrace.sh <kernel> < log`).
4. **Test it.** `make test` runs the kernel's test suite, built with your
   gcc too ([tests/](tests/README.md)).
5. **The whole system**: a cross toolchain (`make toolchain`, about 15
   minutes), then `make run` boots it with a shell, the core utilities
   and logins, as below.

For aarch64, `make run-min CONFIG=aarch64-virt` (needs `clang`, `ld.lld`
and `qemu-system-aarch64`); for i386, `CONFIG=i386-pc` (gcc with 32-bit
support).

## Building

Everything is built from source into `build/` (the x86-64 system into
`build/x86_64`). On a Linux host you need a C/C++ compiler with 32-bit
support, `make`, `bison`, `flex`, `texinfo`, GMP, MPFR and MPC
development headers, `wget`, `nasm`, `cpio`, `xorriso` and
`qemu-system-x86_64` (and `gperf`, autoconf, automake and libtool for
the ports). On Debian/Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt install build-essential gcc-multilib bison flex texinfo libgmp-dev \
    libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev wget nasm cpio xorriso qemu-system-x86 gperf \
    autoconf automake libtool
```

Then:

```
make toolchain      # x86_64-aquila gcc/binutils, newlib and Limine (once, ~15 min)
make                # kernel, user space programs, contrib/ and initrd
make ports          # optional software (vis, kilo, Lua, ...), included in the initrd
make run-iso        # build the ISO and boot it in QEMU
```

As on the BSDs, some third-party software is part of the base system:
[contrib/](contrib/) (dash as `/bin/sh`, sbase for the core utilities,
runit as init) is fetched from upstream and built by `make`. [ports/](ports/) is
optional software, built with `make ports`.

`make run` boots the kernel directly with the console on the serial port
(log in as `root`, no password). On the screen (`make run-iso`), the
kernel's virtual terminals have logins on `/dev/tty1` to `/dev/tty3`,
Alt+F1 to Alt+F6 switch between them. runit supervises the logins as
services (`/etc/sv`, enabled in `/etc/service`, see `sv`); `poweroff` and
`reboot` shut down through it, as does Ctrl+Alt+Del. `make iso` only builds
`build/x86_64/aquila.iso`. With the ports (`make ports`), `startx` on the screen
starts X: twm and an xterm (Ctrl+Alt+F1 to Ctrl+Alt+F6 switch terminals
from it).

The ISO and `make run` boot the ramdisk, read-only and the same on every
boot. `make hdd` makes `build/x86_64/aquila.img`, a hard disk with AquilaOS
installed: Limine on a FAT32 `/boot`, the root filesystem on ext2
(`root=/dev/hda2`), where what is written is kept. `make run-hdd` boots
it (making it the first time) with the system just built: `make
hdd-update` puts the kernel and the system's files on it and keeps the
rest (home directories, and the accounts in `/etc`), `make hdd-kernel`
only the kernel, `make hdd` makes the whole disk anew. See the top of the [Makefile](Makefile)
for all targets.

### Network

The kernel drives Intel 8254x Ethernet cards (e1000), QEMU's default;
`lo`, the loopback interface (127.0.0.1), is always there. IPv4 is
configured with the kernel argument `ip=<address>/<prefix
length>[:<gateway>]`, e.g. `ip=10.0.2.15/24:10.0.2.2` for QEMU's user
network, or on the running system:

```
ifconfig eth0 10.0.2.15 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
route add default gw 10.0.2.2
ping 10.0.2.2
```

or from a DHCP server (sdhcp, contrib): `ifconfig eth0 up; sdhcp eth0`,
which sets the address, the default route and `/etc/resolv.conf`, and
renews the lease. On a disk, the `dhcp` service does it at every boot
once enabled: `ln -s /etc/sv/dhcp /etc/service/`.

Programs have TCP (`SOCK_STREAM`), UDP and ping sockets (`SOCK_DGRAM`,
`IPPROTO_ICMP`). Host names are looked up in `/etc/hosts`, then with
the DNS servers `/etc/resolv.conf` names (DHCP's), e.g.
`nc example.com 80`.

### i386

The default is x86-64. AquilaOS also runs on i386 (using at most
768 MiB of memory, what its kernel maps), which is built into
`build/` with an i686-aquila toolchain (next to the x86_64 one in
`build/toolchain`), `CONFIG=i386-pc` selects it:

```
make toolchain CONFIG=i386-pc       # i686-aquila gcc/binutils and newlib
make CONFIG=i386-pc                 # build/
make hdd CONFIG=i386-pc             # build/aquila.img
make test CONFIG=i386-pc            # or tests/run.sh -a i386
```

## Testing

```
make test           # or tests/run.sh
```

boots the kernel in QEMU with test programs and checks the system built
from source, see [tests/](tests/README.md).

## Documentation

How the kernel works, subsystem by subsystem, is in
[docs/kernel/](docs/kernel/README.md). Its code reference, from the
comments in the sources:

```
make docs           # build/docs/kernel/api/index.html (needs doxygen)
make docs-serve     # the same, on http://localhost:8000/
```
