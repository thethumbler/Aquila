/** \file
 * The block cache: what the disks read and write, kept in 4 KiB blocks.
 *
 * Writes stay in the cache (write back) until `blkcache_flush()` writes
 * them to the disk: for `sync()`, before restarting or powering off, when
 * too much was written (`DIRTY_MAX`), or at the next use of the cache once
 * a write is old enough (`DIRTY_AGE`). Each sector of a block is either
 * valid (it has the disk's data, or newer) or not, and either dirty (newer
 * than the disk's) or not, so a write doesn't need to read the rest of its
 * block. When the cache is full, the clean block used least recently
 * makes room.
 *
 * Drivers use the cache with absolute sector numbers, after adding the
 * partition's offset, so a sector is cached once, whichever device node
 * it was read through. The blocks that a read needs and the cache doesn't
 * have are read with one command, and adjacent dirty blocks are written
 * with one.
 *
 * The device's transfers are always to and from the cache's own buffers,
 * never the caller's. The caller's buffer may be a process's, which isn't
 * mapped until it is touched, and mapping it may read the disk: the
 * driver would wait for itself. The caller's buffer is only used once its
 * pages are mapped.
