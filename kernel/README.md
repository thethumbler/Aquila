# The AquilaOS kernel

How it works, subsystem by subsystem, is in
[docs/kernel/](../docs/kernel/README.md); start there.

| `mm/`      | physical pages (buddy), the kernel heap (kvmem), address spaces, page faults |
| `sys/`     | processes, threads, the scheduler, system calls, signals     |
| `fs/`      | the VFS, and initramfs, tmpfs, devfs, devpts, procfs, ext2, minix |
| `dev/`     | the device layer and the drivers                             |
| `net/`     | Unix sockets, IPv4 (ARP, ICMP, UDP, TCP)                     |
