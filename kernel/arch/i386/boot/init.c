/** \file
 * i386: the kernel's first steps in C, moving itself to the higher half.
 *
 * The boot code (`multiboot.S`) calls `x86_bootstrap()` with paging off.
 * It builds boot page tables that map the start of physical memory twice,
 * at 0 and at the kernel's virtual base (3 GiB), turns paging on, moves
 * the stack to the higher half, and goes on to `x86_cpu_init()`.
 *
 * Only i386 builds this file: x86_64 does the same in assembly
 * (`x86_64_bootstrap.S`).
