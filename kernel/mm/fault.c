 * Page faults: a process's page brought in when it first touches it.

 * A process's memory is mapped lazily. A page is mapped only when the
 * process first reads or writes it, and the fault that the access raises
 * comes here. The page comes from one of three places, tried in order:
 *
 * 1. the process's anon (`vm_anon`), the pages it has written to, which
 *    copy on write when a fork shares them;
 * 2. the object the mapping is of (`vm_object`): a file's pages, read in
 *    by its pager;
 * 3. a new page, zeroed.
 *
 * See docs/kernel/memory.md.
